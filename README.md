# Introduction
This is an database application for CSE 201 where we create a one-stop repository to discover
new movies and to get information about them. We chose to make a web application that applies
front and back end development and application logic.

# Scope of Functionalities
Our functionalities include: allowing a user to view the database, log-in to or create an account
for the database, search content from any page, and request modifications to be made to the content.
