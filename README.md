# Movie Marathon Database by S.H.A.M.S Software
CSE 201 - Introduction to Software Engineering (Spring 2021)

Made by Matt Bailey, Amber Carrico, Josh Hill, and Jared Shapiro

# Introduction
This is an database application for CSE 201 where we create a one-stop repository to discover
new movies and to get information about them. We chose to make a web application that applies
front and back end development and application logic.

# Scope of Functionalities
Our functionalities include: allowing a user to view the database, log-in to or create an account
for the database, search content from any page, and request modifications to be made to the content.

# Building and Running the Project
The project can be built by first downloading/installing Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/). In the cloned directory, open a terminal and enter 'npm install'. This will download all required libraries. The project can then be run by entering 'npm start'. This will open a local host of the server on your pc.
